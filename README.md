# Web-Scraping-101
Learning web scraping using youtube and other open-source tools

The code and ideas in this repository are part of my learning journey to understand web scraping. So far, the code uses Python library BeautifulSoup. 
Rerunning the code in the notebook may yield different results due to the dynamic nature of the websites. 

Special thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVv6mJpFOb0 for helping me get here.
